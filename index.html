		<h2>Who is Agent 47?</h2>
		<p>47, known by very few as Tobias Rieper, is a paid assassin and a clone. He gets his name from being the 47th clone created from the DNA of five different men, made to be perfect assassins who could easily maintain peak physicality and intelligence while easily being controlled by whoever they were devoted to, usually a handler.</p>
